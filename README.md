# Brown-Euroleague

The aim of this repository is test how Machine Learning Algorithms (ML) can be applied to basketball-based European Datasets. Although the given examples are quite simple (build-in scikit-learn functions).
In particular, this tutorial about ML gold-standards have been included only **Classification**, where SVM, K Neighbors and Random Forest Classifier are used to build a model able to classify player positions.
